1. Note: I'm providing this minimal summary because the chat history contains only a single, brief request, and while there are previous interactions about a file management system, they appear unrelated to the current request about adding a new bank. Following the guidelines to prioritize the chat history and focus on the most recent explicit intentions, I've included only what was directly stated in the latest message.
