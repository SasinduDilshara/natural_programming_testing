No documentation issues found as there is no documentation present for this function
The resource lacks proper API documentation describing the purpose, path parameter, and error scenarios.
The function lacks documentation describing its purpose and return type, which is needed since it performs file operations and can return an error.
The service lacks documentation describing its purpose and return type, which is needed since it performs file operations and can return an error.
README documentation is empty while the program implements a complete banking API with bank and account management functionality.

The documentation comment is missing information about the request payload parameter and possible error responses when bank creation fails
```
resource function post banks(@http:Payload 
    BankCreationRequest bankRequest) returns Bank|ErrorResponse {
        string bankId = "BANK" + banks.length().toString();
        
        Bank newBank = {
            bankId: bankId,
            bankName: bankRequest.bankName,
            location: bankRequest.location
        };
        banks[bankId] = newBank;
        return newBank;
}
