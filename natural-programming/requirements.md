# **Requirement Analysis Document**  
**Project Name**: Order Management System API  
**Version**: 1.0  
**Date**: [Insert Date]  

---

## **1. Introduction**  
This document outlines the functional and non-functional requirements for the Order Management System API. The system is designed to provide RESTful APIs for managing orders and users, enabling users to create, update, delete, and retrieve orders and user information.

---

## **2. Functional Requirements**  

### **2.1 Order Management**  
The system must provide the following functionalities for managing orders:  

1. **Create an Order**  
   - **Endpoint**: `POST /orders`  
   - **Input**: `OrderCreationRequest` JSON payload.  
   - **Output**: Created `Order` object.  
   - **Description**: Allows users to create a new order with the specified items and user ID.  

2. **Update an Order**  
   - **Endpoint**: `PUT /orders/{orderId}`  
   - **Input**: `Order` JSON payload.  
   - **Output**: Updated `Order` object.  
   - **Description**: Allows users to update an existing order by providing the order ID and updated order details.  

3. **Delete an Order**  
   - **Endpoint**: `DELETE /orders/{orderId}`  
   - **Input**: Order ID as a path parameter.  
   - **Output**: Success or error message.  
   - **Description**: Allows users to delete an order by providing the order ID.  

4. **Get Orders by User**  
   - **Endpoint**: `GET /orders/users/{userId}`  
   - **Input**: User ID as a path parameter.  
   - **Output**: List of `Order` objects.  
   - **Description**: Retrieves all orders associated with a specific user ID.  

5. **Get User Orders**  
   - **Endpoint**: `GET /users/{userId}/orders`  
   - **Input**: User ID as a path parameter.  
   - **Output**: List of `Order` objects.  
   - **Description**: Retrieves all orders for a specific user.  

---

### **2.2 User Management**  
The system must provide the following functionalities for managing users:  

1. **Get All Users**  
   - **Endpoint**: `GET /users`  
   - **Input**: None.  
   - **Output**: List of `User` objects.  
   - **Description**: Retrieves a list of all users in the system.  

---

## **3. Data Structures**  

### **3.1 Order**  
```json
{
    "orderId": "string",
    "userId": "string",
    "items": [
        {
            "itemId": "string",
            "quantity": "int",
            "price": "decimal"
        }
    ],
    "totalAmount": "decimal",
    "status": "string"
}
```

### **3.2 OrderCreationRequest**  
```json
{
    "userId": "string",
    "items": [
        {
            "itemId": "string",
            "quantity": "int",
            "price": "decimal"
        }
    ]
}
```

### **3.3 User**  
```json
{
    "userId": "string",
    "userName": "string",
    "email": "string"
}
```

---

## **4. Error Handling**  
The system must handle errors gracefully and return the following error response structure:  
```json
{
    "message": "string",
    "code": "string"
}
```

---

## **5. Non-Functional Requirements**  

1. **Performance**:  
   - The system should handle up to 1,000 concurrent requests with a response time of less than 500ms.  

2. **Availability**:  
   - The system should have an uptime of 99.9%.  

3. **Security**:  
   - All API endpoints must be secured using HTTPS.  
   - Sensitive data (e.g., user email) must be encrypted.  

4. **Scalability**:  
   - The system should be scalable to support future increases in user and order volume.  

---

## **6. Deployment and Running**  
- The service must be deployed and accessible at `http://localhost:8080/`.  
- The service can be started using the command:  
  ```sh
  bal run
  ```

---

## **7. Assumptions and Constraints**  
1. The system assumes that all users and orders are stored in a database.  
2. The system does not include user authentication or authorization in this version.  
3. The system assumes that all input data is validated before processing.  

---

## **8. Future Enhancements**  
1. Add user authentication and authorization.  
2. Implement pagination for retrieving large lists of orders and users.  
3. Add support for filtering and sorting orders.  

---

## **9. Approval**  
This document has been reviewed and approved by the following stakeholders:  

| Name               | Role                  | Signature | Date       |
