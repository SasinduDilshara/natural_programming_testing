## Claim Management Platform
Users can submit and track expense claims online.  
Claims of $10 or less are automatically approved.  
If the total exceeds $10, the claim is marked pending and an email is sent to the user and finance at `finance@example.com`.  
The user receives the claim ID and its status in the response.  
Only the user who submitted the claim can check its status using the claim ID.
